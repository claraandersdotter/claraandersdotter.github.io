                <p><span>Project scope:</span>  Creation of a game in collaboration with Prison Island</p>
                <p>This project explored the dynamics of teamwork and collaboration within interaction design
                     and the entertainment company Prison Island. The aim was to develop a new game cell, 
                     Twister with a twist, where teamwork and communication are essential. </p>

            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>The project started with an ideation session, mainly brainstorming
                 and braindrawing, to generate many ideas within a limited timeframe. 
                 After that, low-fidelity prototypes were made in different stages to develop 
                 the final idea further. Finally, a high-fidelity prototype was made to visualize 
                 the cell concept for Prison Island. The primary objective was to construct a visual representation 
                 that could be presented to the intended users for evaluation and feedback. The high-fidelity prototype 
                 was constructed using chipboards and joists. On the surface of the chipboard, 23 circles were marked 
                 out and then painted in the original Twister colors: red, green, blue, and yellow. Six holes were 
                 drilled around each circle, and behind each hole, an LED strip was positioned to illuminate based on an 
                 Arduino code.</p>

        <h2>The result</h2>
            <p>The developed cell Twister with a twist is an innovative take on the classic Twister game. In contrast to the 
                traditional competitive nature of Twister, this version promotes teamwork and collaboration among players to 
                collect points. To succeed in this game, participants must operate as a team to reach maximum points. 
                Communication is essential since team members must synchronize their movements, predict each other's actions, 
                and provide clear instructions to ensure efficient gameplay.</p>
