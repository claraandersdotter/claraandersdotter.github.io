            <h2>The problem</h2>
            <p>About one-third of breast cancer tumors reach a size where they are noticeable to women, often signifying
                advanced stages of the disease and complicating treatment. This could be due to the tumor being either
                rapidly growing or not detected early enough by medical professionals. The AI startup Aileen Health uses
                generative AI to simulate cancer by creating future medical images that predict when and where breast cancer might occur.
                This approach aims to make patients more aware of their risk, help radiologists avoid invasive procedures,
                and help pharma identify treatment responses for patients.

            <h2>Purpose of the Master's thesis</h2>
            <p>To ensure successful AI implementation, radiologists must trust and adapt to the new system. This master's thesis 
                investigated how radiologists interact with AI, focusing on optimizing the presentation of AI-generated visualizations 
                to build trust, promote adoption, and facilitate effective usage. The thesis aimed to answer the following 
                research question: What are the key factors for building trust and integrating AI-based predictions into the current 
                mammography screening workflow to support radiologists?</p>

            <h2>The process</h2>
            <p>Our process began with an extensive literature review to gain a deeper understanding
                of breast cancer and the current use of AI in this field. We used an iterative design
                process with five phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Furthermore, we conducted interviews and 
                observations with breast radiologists. These insights led to the development of requirements and guidelines for our 
                final design solution.</p>

            <h2>The result</h2>
            <p>
                The design proposal includes three main components: the Future Multiview, the Future AI Overview, and the Landing Page. 
                Together, these elements aim to build radiologists' trust in the AI system and encourage its integration into their 
                workflow to improve patient care.
