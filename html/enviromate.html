                <p><span>Project scope:</span>  Creation of an AI tool for researchers</p>
                <p>This project investigates 
                    the role of researchers in addressing climate change and explores the potential of Artificial 
                    Intelligence (AI) to improve how organizations and researchers operate in this context. The aim was 
                    to develop a service that becomes a researcher's ultimate companion, offering support in reducing the 
                    time spent writing reports and communicating research findings. Like a best friend, this service understands 
                    that researchers want to focus on conducting groundbreaking research rather than getting stuck in 
                    communication issues.</p>

            <h2>EnviroMate</h2>
            <p>An online tool based on an AI model that enables
                researchers to input data and swiftly generate content for
                publication.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>What is its function?</h2>
            <p>To improve workflow times and researcher's

            <h2>An overview of the AI</h2>
            <p>Several alternative solutions were studied to address the possibility 
                of using AI to help the researcher communicate their findings in different formats. 
                Through careful evaluation, six key features were chosen to empower researchers to 
                effectively communicate their results to a broader audience. To further clarify the purpose 
                and functionality of the system, the identified features were categorized into three 
                different categories: Writing Assistant, Visualization, and Presentation. These categories 
                contained different features that aimed to assist researchers in various stages of converting their discoveries.</p>

            <h2>Writing Assistant</h2>
            <p>In this project, developing an AI writing assistance required implementing a pre-trained 
                model called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). In addition, the model was 
                fine-tuned using datasets to optimize its performance and accuracy. </p>

    <div class="vis">
        <div>
            <h2>Visualization</h2>
            <p>The system also offered a visualization tool, which assisted researchers in communicating their 
                information more effectively. To make these features feasible, a collaboration was formed with the 
                company Flourish to avoid the substantial costs associated with training and developing models for 
                diverse visualizations. Moreover, EnviroMate offered a convenient interface and 
                acted as a reliable guide by suggesting the most suitable visualizations for each occasion. By analyzing the 
                data and the selected target group, EnviroMate provided valuable recommendations tailored to specific needs. 
                A rule-based approach enabled the recommendations using specific guidelines and criteria to determine the 
                appropriate visualizations for different scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Presentation</h2>
            <p>EnviroMate also provided a feature for generating scripts for oral speeches and presentation slides. However, 
                since no pre-existing datasets contained scripts and related reports, we needed to create the sets from scratch.</p>
